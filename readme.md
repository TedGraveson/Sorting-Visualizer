## Description
This project is a result of a personal desire to build GUI applications in python, as well as improving my competence in executed objected oriented designs, threads, and event-based programs.

Random integer arrays of various sizes are visualized as bar graphs, and users can select from a set of sorting algorithms to observe these arrays being sorted in ascending order in real time. A rough example of the importance of algorithm complextiy can also be seen as users are able to see multiple algorithms sort equivalent arrays at the same time. 
## Implemented Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort (modified to operate in place)
